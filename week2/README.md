# Intro to Statistics and Machine Learning

## Day 1
  * See the [Statistical Inference & Hypothesis Testing](Statistics%201.pptx) slides
  * Review the [sampling means Rmarkdown file](sampling%20means%20HW.Rmd) (preview the output [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/msr-ds3/coursework/blob/master/week2/sampling_means_HW.html))
