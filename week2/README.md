# Intro to Statistics and Machine Learning

## Day 1
  * See the [Statistical Inference & Hypothesis Testing](intro_to_stats.pptx) slides
  * Review the [statistical inference Rmarkdown file](statistical_inference.Rmd) (preview the output [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/msr-ds3/coursework/blob/master/week2/statistical_inference.html))
  * Interactive demos from the slides:
    * [Student t-distribution](http://rpsychologist.com/d3/tdist/)
    * From the [Seeing theory](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/) site:
      * [Random variables](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/probability-distributions/index.html#section1)
      * [Basic probability](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/basic-probability/index.html)
      * [Central limit theorem](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/probability-distributions/index.html#section3)
      * [Confidence intervals](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/frequentist-inference/index.html#section2)
    * An [interactive tutorial on sampling variability in polling](http://rocknpoll.graphics)

  * Read Chapter 7 of [Introduction to Statistical Thinking (With R, Without Calculus)](http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~msby/StatThink/) for a recap of sampling distributions. Feel free to execute code in the book along the way.
  * Do question 7.1
  * Read Chapters 9, 10, and 11 of [Introduction to Statistical Thinking (With R, Without Calculus)](http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~msby/StatThink/)
  * For background:
    *  Chapter 4 has a good review of population distributions, expectations, and variance
    *  Chapter 5 has a recap of random variables
    *  Chapter 6 has more information on the normal distribution
  * Go through the [sampling means Rmarkdown file](sampling_means_HW.Rmd) (preview the output [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/msr-ds3/coursework/blob/master/week2/sampling_means_HW.html)), and complete the last exercise
  * See section 4 of [Mindless Statistics](http://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/gg/GG_Mindless_2004.pdf) for some warnings on misinterpretations of p-values

<!--
  * Review the third chapter of [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/index.html) and work on the associated lab
