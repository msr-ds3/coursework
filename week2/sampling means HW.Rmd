# Question: Take a normal distribution with mu = 10 and variance of 9 (e.g., standard deviation of 3).  Simulate a population of 10,000.  What is the sample size needed to make the standard error of the sample mean sufficiently small so that no more than 5% of the sample means are less 9?

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
