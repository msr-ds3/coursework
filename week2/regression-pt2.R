# ISRS Exercise 6.1
#  The Child Health and Development Studies investigate a range of
# topics. One study considered all pregnancies between 1960 and 1967 among women in the Kaiser
# Foundation Health Plan in the San Francisco East Bay area. Here, we study the relationship
# between smoking and weight of the baby. The variable smoke is coded 1 if the mother is a
# smoker, and 0 if not. The summary table below shows the results of a linear regression model for
# predicting the average birth weight of babies, measured in ounces, based on the smoking status of
# the mother.
# Coefficients:
#               Estimate  Std. Error  t value  Pr(>|t|)
# (Intercept)    123.05        0.65   189.60    0.0000
# smoke           -8.94        1.03    -8.65    0.0000

# The variability within the smokers and non-smokers are about equal and the distributions are
# symmetric. With these conditions satisfied, it is reasonable to apply the model. (Note that we
# don’t need to check linearity since the predictor has only two levels.)
babyweights <- read.table("babyweights.txt", header = TRUE)

# a. Write the equation of the regression line.
# b. Interpret the slope in this context, and calculate the predicted birth weight of babies born to
# smoker and non-smoker mothers.
# c. Is there a statistically significant relationship between the average birth weight and smoking?

# ISRS Exercise 6.2
# Exercise 6.1 introduces a data set on birth weight of babies.
#Another variable we consider is parity, which is 0 if the child is the first born, and 1 otherwise.
#The summary table below shows the results of a linear regression model for predicting the average
# birth weight of babies, measured in ounces, from parity
# Coefficients:
#               Estimate  Std. Error  t value  Pr(>|t|)
# (Intercept)    120.07        0.60   199.94    0.0000
# parity          -1.93        1.19    -1.62    0.1052
#
# a. Write the equation of the regression line.
# b. Interpret the slope in this context, and calculate the predicted birth weight of first borns and
#    others.
# c. Is there a statistically significant relationship between the average birth weight and parity?

# ISRS Exercise 6.3
# We considered the variables smoke and parity, one at a time, in
# modeling birth weights of babies in Exercises 6.1 and 6.2. A more realistic approach to modeling
# infant weights is to consider all possibly related variables at once. Other variables of interest
# include length of pregnancy in days (gestation), mother’s age in years (age), mother’s height in
# inches (height), and mother’s pregnancy weight in pounds (weight). Below are three observations
# from this data set.

# Data set observations (n = 1,236):
#        bwt  gestation  parity  age  height  weight  smoke
# 1      120        284       0   27      62     100      0
# 2      113        282       0   33      64     135      0
# ...
# 1236   117        297       0   38      65     129      0

# Coefficients:
#               Estimate  Std. Error  t value  Pr(>|t|)
# (Intercept)    -80.41       14.35    -5.60    0.0000
# gestation        0.44        0.03    15.26    0.0000

# a. Write the equation of the regression line that includes all variables:
# b. Interpret the slopes of gestation and age in this context:
# c. The coefficient for parity is different than in the linear model shown in Exercise 6.2. Why
#    might there be a difference?
# d. Calculate the residual for the first observation in the dataset.
# e. The variance of the residuals is 249.28, and the variance of the birth weights of all babies
#    in the data set is 332.57. Calculate the R^2 and the adjusted R^2. Note that there are 1,236
#    bservations in the data set.
