This week covers replications and extensions of [Predicting the present](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/2011/ptp.pdf) by Choi and Varian on using search data to "nowcast" real-world outcomes. You'll work in groups of 2 for this.

1. Start by reading the paper.

2. Then use the [author provided data](original_autos_data_from_authors) to replicate the results of section 3.1 for models to predict car sales in the U.S.  See the `merged.csv` file.

3. Now track down the original source data online for car sales and auto-related searches, following links in the paper. Try using these data to replicate the results of section 3.1, and compare to step 2 above.

4. From here think about extensions. These might involve the autos models (Section 3.1) or models for other domains. Ideas for a few things you might try:  extending the models to current day examining how they perform over time, predicting the future instead of the present, improving the models with other features or data, or introducing new domains.

5. Write up all of your results in an Rmarkdown notebook file. Commit the source code and the rendered notebook to your group's Github repository:

  * [Group 1](https://github.com/msr-ds3/predicting-the-present-2020-group-1)
  * [Group 2](https://github.com/msr-ds3/predicting-the-present-2020-group-2)
  * [Group 3](https://github.com/msr-ds3/predicting-the-present-2020-group-3)
