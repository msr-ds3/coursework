This week covers replications and extensions of [this article](https://github.com/msr-ds3/coursework/blob/master/week4/ft_police_complaints.pdf) on complaints filed against police officers in NYC, Chicago, and Philadelphia. You'll work in groups of 2 for this.

1. Start by reading the paper. Concentrate on the first figure, the three panels showing how complaints are disproportionately concentrated among the top decilce of officers who draw the most complaints. This will be the main result to replicate in the paper.

2. Then read the methodology details at the end of the article, and follow the links to the datasets that were used. Take a look at the NYC data set and read the specific steps that were done to filter the data and deal with complaints containing more than one allegation. Sketch out a plan for how you can use this data to get the results in the main figure.

3. Write reproducible code to create the middle panel of the figure for officers in NYC.

4. Do the same as steps 2 and 3, but for Chicago and Philadelphia, looking at the data and noting differences in how they were cleaned or handled based on the methodology writeup at the end of the article.

5. From here think about extensions to the article. Each group will probably come up with different questions to ask of the data. Write down the questions your group is interested in along with a plan for how you can tackle them with the data you have. 

6. Write one Rmarkdown notebook file that contains all of your results, including the replication of the article figure and your extension. Commit the source code and rendered notebook to your group's Github repository (links for that coming soon).

2. Then use the [author provided data](original_autos_data_from_authors) to replicate the results of section 3.1 for models to predict car sales in the U.S.  See the `merged.csv` file.

3. Now track down the original source data online for car sales and auto-related searches, following links in the paper. Try using these data to replicate the results of section 3.1, and compare to step 2 above.

4. From here think about extensions. These might involve the autos models (Section 3.1) or models for other domains. Ideas for a few things you might try:  extending the models to current day examining how they perform over time, predicting the future instead of the present, improving the models with other features or data, or introducing new domains.

5. Write up all of your results in an Rmarkdown notebook file. Commit the source code and the rendered notebook to your group's Github repository:

  * [Group 1](https://github.com/msr-ds3/predicting-the-present-2020-group-1)
  * [Group 2](https://github.com/msr-ds3/predicting-the-present-2020-group-2)
  * [Group 3](https://github.com/msr-ds3/predicting-the-present-2020-group-3)
  * [Group 4](https://github.com/msr-ds3/predicting-the-present-2020-group-4)
