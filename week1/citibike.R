# YOUR SOLUTIONS BELOW
########################################

# count the number of trips (= rows in the data frame)

# find the earliest and latest birth years (see help for max and min to deal with NAs)

# use filter and grepl to find all trips that either start or end on broadway

# do the same, but find all trips that both start and end on broadway

# find all unique station names

# count the number of trips by gender

# compute the average trip time by gender
# comment on whether there's a (statistically) significant difference

# find the 10 most frequent station-to-station trips

# find the top 3 end stations for trips starting from each start station

# find the top 3 most common station-to-station trips by gender

# find the day with the most trips
# tip: first add a column for year/month/day without time of day (use as.Date or floor_date from the lubridate package)

# compute the average number of trips taken during each of the 24 hours of the day across the entire month
# what time(s) of day tend to be peak hour(s)?
