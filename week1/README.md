This week covers:

  * An intro to Git and Github for sharing code
  * Command line tools
  * Exploratory data analysis with R

# Day 1

## Setup

Install tools: [Ubuntu on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about), GitHub for Windows, R, and RStudio

### Ubuntu on Windows
  * Open [http://aka.ms/wslstore]() and select Ubuntu on Windows
  * If this seems like it's hanging, hit enter
  * Create a username and password
  * Updates all packages with `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade`

### Git / GitHub for Windows
  * Check that you have git under bash by typing `git --version` in the terminal
  * Install [GitHub for Windows](https://desktop.github.com)
  * Configure git to deal with line endings in a cross-platform friendly way: `git config --global core.autocrlf true`

### R and RStudio
  
  * Download and install R from a [CRAN mirror](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
  * Download and install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
  * Open RStudio and install the `tidyverse` package, which includes  `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and more: `install.packages('tidyverse', dependencies = T)`

### Text editor

  * You'll need a plain text editing program
  * [Atom](https://atom.io), [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com), and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) are all good options

## Intro to Git(Hub)

### Make your first commit and pull request
  * [Sign up](https://github.com/join) for a free GitHub account
  * Then follow this guide to [fork your own copy](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) of the course repository
  * [Clone a copy of your forked repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), which should be located at ``git@github.com/<yourusername>/coursework.git``, to your local machine
  * Once that's done, create a new file in the ``week1/students`` directory, ``<yourfirstname>.txt`` (e.g., ``jake.txt``)
  * Use ``git add`` to add the file to your local repository
  * Use ``git commit`` and ``git push`` to commit and push your changes to your copy of the repository
  * Then issue a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request) to send the changes back to the original course repository
  * Finally, [configure a remote repository](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) called ``upstream`` to point here:
```
    git remote add upstream git@github.com:msr-ds3/coursework
```
  * This will allow you to [sync future changes](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) to your fork with:
```
    git fetch upstream
	git merge upstream/master
```
  * Note: this is equivalent to ``git pull upstream master``

## Intro to the Command Line
  * See the [intro to the command line](intro_command_line.ipynb) notebook and the [download trips script](download_trips.sh)
  * Read through [Lifehacker's command line primer](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything)
