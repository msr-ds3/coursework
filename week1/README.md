This week covers:

  * An intro to Git and Github for sharing code
  * Command line tools
  * Exploratory data analysis with R

# Day 1

## Setup

Install tools: [Ubuntu on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about), GitHub for Windows, R, and RStudio:

### Ubuntu on Windows
  * Type `bash` in the Start Menu, and `y` to install Ubuntu on Windows
  * If this seems like it's hanging, hit enter
  * Create a username and password
  * Updates all packages with `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade`

### Git / GitHub for Windows
  * Check that you have git under bash by typing `git --version` in the terminal
  * Install [GitHub for Windows](https://desktop.github.com)

### R and RStudio
  
  * Download and install R from a [CRAN mirror](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
  * Download and install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
  * Open RStudio and install the `tidyverse` package, which includes  `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and more: `install.packages('tidyverse', dependencies = T)`

### Text editor

  * You'll need a plain text editing program
  * [Atom](https://atom.io) or [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com) should work well

## Intro to Git(Hub)

### Make your first commit and pull request
  * Complete this [free online git course](https://try.github.io) 
  * [Sign up](https://github.com/join) for a free GitHub account
  * Then follow this guide to [fork your own copy](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) of the course repository
  * [Clone a copy of your forked repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), which should be located at ``git@github.com/<yourusername>/coursework.git``, to your local machine
  * Once that's done, create a new file in the ``week1/students`` directory, ``<yourfirstname>.txt`` (e.g., ``jake.txt``)
  * Use ``git add`` to add the file to your local repository
  * Use ``git commit`` and ``git push`` to commit and push your changes to your copy of the repository
  * Then issue a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request) to send the changes back to the original course repository
  * Finally, [configure a remote repository](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) called ``upstream`` to point here:
```
    git remote add upstream git@github.com:msr-ds3/coursework
```
  * This will allow you to [sync future changes](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) to your fork with:
```
    git fetch upstream
	git merge upstream/master
```
  * Note: this is equivalent to ``git pull upstream master``

### Learn more (optional)
  * A full hour-long [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8GBXvdmHT4)
  * More resources from GitHub available [here](https://services.github.com/resources/) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/)
  * And here's a handy [cheatsheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/)
  
## Intro to the Command Line
  * Read through [Lifehacker's command line primer](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything)
  * Do Codecademy's interactive [command line tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/navigation/exercises/your-first-command?action=lesson_resume)

### Learn more (optional)
  * See this [crash course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html) for more details on commonly used commands
  * Check out Software Carpentry's [guide to the Unix shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
  * Review this wikibook on [data analysis on the command line](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ad_Hoc_Data_Analysis_From_The_Unix_Command_Line), covering ``cut``, ``grep``, ``wc``, ``uniq``, ``sort``, etc
  * Learn [awk in 20 minutes](http://ferd.ca/awk-in-20-minutes.html)
  * Check out some more advanced tools for [Data Science at the Command Line](http://datascienceatthecommandline.com)
