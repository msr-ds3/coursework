# aggregate ratings by movie, computing mean and number of ratings
# hint: use the n() function for easy counting within a group

# plot distribution of movie popularity (= number of ratings the movie received)
# hint: try scale_x_log10() for a logarithmic x axis

# plot distribution of mean ratings by movie (slide 23)
# hint: try geom_histogram and geom_density

# rank movies by popularity and compute the cdf, or fraction of movies covered by the top-k moves (slide 25)
# hint: use dplyr's rank and arrange functions, and the base R sum and cumsum functions
# store the result in a new data frame so you can use it in creating figure 2 from the paper below

# plot the CDF of movie popularity

# aggregate ratings by user, computing mean and number of ratings

# plot distribution of user activity (= number of ratings the user made)
# hint: try a log scale here

# generate the equivalent of figure 2 of this paper:
# https://5harad.com/papers/long_tail.pdf

# Specifically, for the subset of users who rated at least 10 movies,
# produce a plot that shows the fraction of users satisfied (vertical
# axis) as a function of inventory size (horizontal axis). We will
# define "satisfied" as follows: an individual user is satisfied p% of
# the time at inventory of size k if at least p% of the movies they
# rated are contained in the top k most popular movies. As in the
# paper, produce one curve for the 100% user satisfaction level and
# another for 90%---do not, however, bother implementing the null
# model (shown in the dashed lines).
