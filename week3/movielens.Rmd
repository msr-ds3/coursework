# generate the equivalent of figure 2a of this paper:
# note: don't worry about the "null model" lines
# just do the solid lines and dotted line (optional)
# https://5harad.com/papers/long_tail.pdf

# Specifically, for the subset of users who rated at least 10 movies,
# produce a plot that shows the fraction of users satisfied (vertical
# axis) as a function of inventory size (horizontal axis). We will
# define "satisfied" as follows: an individual user is satisfied p% of
# the time at inventory of size k if at least p% of the movies they
# rated are contained in the top k most popular movies. As in the
# paper, produce one curve for the 100% user satisfaction level and
# another for 90%---do not, however, bother implementing the null
# model (shown in the dashed lines).
