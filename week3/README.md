This week covers:

  * More statistics: hypothesis testing, effect sizes, and regression

# Day 1

## Hypothesis testing (cont'd)

  * We reviewed hypothesis testing and power calculations on the whiteboard (see [notes](https://github.com/jhofman/msd2019-notes/blob/master/lecture_5/lecture_5.pdf))
  * We went over the quiz in [Mindless Statistics](http://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/gg/GG_Mindless_2004.pdf) by Gigerenzer about common misconceptions around testing and p-values

  * Finish up [last week's stats exercises](https://github.com/msr-ds3/coursework/tree/master/week2#stats-again)

# Day 2

## Field trip

  * We took a field trip to the American Museum of Natural History to visit there [AstroCom data science program](https://cunyastro.org/astrocom/)!


# Day 3

## Effect sizes

  * We talked about false discoveries and effect sizes on the whiteboard (see [notes](https://github.com/jhofman/msd2019-notes/blob/master/lecture_6/lecture_6.pdf))

  * Replicate and extend the results of the [Google n-grams "culturomics" paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6014/176) using the template [here](../week2/ngrams)

# Day 4

## Regression

  * We introduced regression and derived the best-fit parameters for a simple linear model
  * See [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jhofman/modeling-social-data-lecture-7-regression-part-1) for a high-level framing and [notes](https://github.com/jhofman/msd2019-notes/blob/master/lecture_7/lecture_7.pdf) for derivation
  
  * Read Chapter 5 of [Intro to Stats with Randomization and Simulation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-DHaDEbiOGkRHNndUlBaHVmaGM/edit), do exercises 5.20, 5.29
  * Read Section 3.1 of [Intro to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), do Lab 3.6.2
  * See if you can reproduce the table in ISRS 5.29 using [the original dataset](http://jse.amstat.org/v11n2/datasets.heinz.html)
