This week covers several assignments on reproducing the results of published research papers.

# Day 1

## The long tail

* Take a look at [The Anatomy of the Long Tail](https://5harad.com/papers/long_tail.pdf) and think about how to generate Figures 1 and 2 (you can ignore the null model in Figure 2)
* Use the [download_movielens.sh](download_movielens.sh) script to download the [MovieLens data](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
* Fill in code in the [movielens.Rmd](movielens.Rmd) file to reproduce plots from lecture slides and Figures 1 and 2 from the paper
