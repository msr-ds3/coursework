We want the script to do the following:\r\n\r\n* Produce a (pseudo)random pairing of 6 groups of 2 people who get to work together each day on pair programming assignments\r\n* Any one of us should be able to run the script and get the same pairing on a given day (i.e., as long as our computers agree on the year/month/day)\r\n* It's interesting to think about how we might avoid repeated pairs from one day to the next, but for a first cut (and maybe final cut) version of the script you can ignore that issue\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n# Day 2\r\n  \r\n## Intro to the Command Line\r\n  * See this [intro to the command line](intro_command_line.ipynb) notebook \r\n  * Read through [Lifehacker's command line primer](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything)\r\n  * See [Linux Journey's shell lesson](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell)\r\n\r\n### Learn more (optional)\r\n  * See this [crash course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html) for more details on commonly used commands\r\n  * Check out Software Carpentry's [guide to the Unix shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)\r\n  * Review this wikibook on [data analysis on the command line](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ad_Hoc_Data_Analysis_From_The_Unix_Command_Line), covering ``cut``, ``grep``, ``wc``, ``uniq``, ``sort``, etc\r\n  * Learn [awk in 20 minutes](http://ferd.ca/awk-in-20-minutes.html)\r\n  * Check out some more advanced tools for [Data Science at the Command Line](http://datascienceatthecommandline.com)\r\n  * Do Codecademy's interactive [command line tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) (the free portion)\r\n  * See these [Introduction to Counting](https://speakerdeck.com/jhofman/modeling-social-data-lecture-2-introduction-to-counting) slides\r\n\r\n## Command line exercises\r\n  * Pull changes from the msr-ds3/coursework repo: `git pull upstream master`\r\n  * Use the [download_trips.sh](download_trips.sh) file to download Citibike trip data by running `bash download_trips.sh` or `./download_trips.sh`\r\n  * Fill in solutions under each comment in [citibike.sh](citibike.sh) using the `201402-citibike-tripdata.csv` file\r\n\r\n\r\n## Save your work\r\n  * Make sure to save your work and push it to GitHub. Do this in three steps:\r\n  \t1. `git add` and `git commit` and new files to your local repository. (Omit large data files.)\r\n  \t2. `git pull upstream master` to grab changes from this repository, and resolve any merge conflicts, commiting the final results.\r\n  \t3. `git push origin master` to push things back up to your GitHub fork of the course repository.\r\n  * Finish by submitting a pull request with your solutions so we can review them! (We won't merge the request, but it's a good way for the TA to provide feedback.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Day 3\r\n\r\n## Intro to R\r\n\r\n  * See the [Data Wrangling in
